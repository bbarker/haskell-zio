Haskell Type,Scala Type,Notes
UIO a,UIO[A],This is a type alias in Scala but a concrete type in Haskell due to UIO being an inner monadic type.
URIO r a,"URIO[R, A] ",
Task a,Task[A] ,
RIO r a,"RIO[R, A] ","Same idea as in Scala. Not to be confused with the RIO library’s `RIO` monad, but they are isomorphic."
EIO e a,"IO[E, A] ",This is a type alias in Scala but a concrete type in Haskell due to EIO being an inner monadic type.
